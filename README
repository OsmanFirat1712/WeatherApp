The app language is 100% Kotlin

How to use it?

When the first app starts, it will ask you for you location permission if the permission is guarenteed then you will get the current weather infos in your For You screen.
You can add a pin on the map on a long click.
When you click on a pin that you added before you will see the current Weather and the city name.
You can search for a city and it will automaticly addded to your Favorites when the city exits in the citylist.json file.
You can delete on the Favorite Screen on a longclick or go to the detailpage on a onclick.
On the map we dont implemented the method to delete a marker because we thought it isnt that user friendly.
The view on the detailpage change when its night.

You can swipe to refresh to get the new data when is avabilable, and it supports offline mode which means you can use it without internet when you had added before favorites.
Edit a Favorite is not supported because its not user friendly before you edit a Favorite you will delete it and add a new one.
In the Settings seciton you can unfourtanely only enable Darkmode, switiching metrics is not implemented yet..

When you give the permission for you location please swipe to refresh the ForYou screen to get the weather for your currentlocation
When you press the Floating button the icon on the buttom nav. bar will not change to the Mapview icon, i dont know why it suppossed to be a bug in the Emulator.
When the expection "grpc failed" is thrown, please wipe the data from the Emulator.
When on the FIRST APP start the ForYou Page doesnt show you added pins, please restart the app then it should work fine.
There a few codeblocks we dont use yet but we want to expand the Project in near future because of that i dont delete it.
It supports German & English.
For this app we use Google Pixel 2.
