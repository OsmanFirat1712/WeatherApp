The app language is 100% Kotlin

How to use it?

When the first app starts, you will see a blank screen and when you switch to the Mapview it will ask you for you location permission if the permission is guarenteed then you will get the current weather infos in your For You screen.
You can add a pin on the map on a long click.
When you click on a pin that you added before you will see the current Weather
You can search for a city and it will automaticly addded to your Favorites when the City exits.
You can delete on the Favorite Screen on a longclick or go to the detailpage on a onclick.
In the Settings seciton you can unfourtanely only enable Darkmode, switiching metrics is not implemented yet.

There is a bug where the AlertDialog adds a Favorite even you press the cancel button, you can simply fix this by deleting this code
-go to the MapviewFragment.kt 
- copy the code block 141-144 and delete it and make a space at code block 184 and paste it there, then it should work fine.
actually you dont need that code block 143, you can delete that too.

When the expection "grpc failed" thrown, please wipe the data from the Emulator
When on the first app start doesnt show you added pins, please restart the app then it should work fine.
For  this app we use Google Pixel 2
